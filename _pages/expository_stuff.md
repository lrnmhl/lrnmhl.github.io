I like writing about mathematics, so I expect this page to fill up eventually.

#### Some talks

- [Introduction to the K-theory of C*-algebras]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/K-theory-Talk.pdf), December 2023, for the seminar on Kasparov's KK-theory organized by Prof. Koen van den Dungen.

- [Introduction to pure motives]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/Chow_and_Motives.pdf), November 2022, for the seminar on Chow groups and motives organized by Prof. Daniel Huybrechts. These notes also include as a companion piece the talk by my friend Thomas Manopulo on Chow groups.

#### Some old lecure notes

I cannot really recommend reading the following notes (my notetaking has improved considerably since I took these courses), but there might be some interesting tidbits here and there.

- [Algebraic Topology I]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/AT1.pdf), taught by Prof. Stefan Schwede in the Winter Semester 21/22. Might be a good introduction to simplicial sets and some other basic tools of the trade and fundamental results in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

- [Algebraic Topology II]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/AT2.pdf), taught by Prof. Stefan Schwede in the Summer Semester 22. Someone might find worthwile the detailed introduction to cofibration categories (more general and somewhat easier to deal with than model categories, but still powerful) and triangulated categories.

- [Representation Theory II]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/RT2.pdf), taught by Prof. Catharina Stroppel in Winter Semester 22/23. An introduction to some of the basics of geometric representation theory (e.g. flag and Schubert varieties, Coxeter groups), which might be more elementary and concrete than most.
