I like writing about mathematics, so I expect this page to fill up eventually.

#### Some talks

- [Introduction to the K-theory of C\*-algebras]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/talks/Operator_K-theory_Talk.pdf), December 2023, for the seminar on Kasparov's KK-theory organized by Prof. Koen van den Dungen.

- [Introduction to pure motives]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/talks/Chow_Groups_and_Pure_Motives_Talks.pdf), November 2022, for the seminar on Chow groups and motives organized by Prof. Daniel Huybrechts. These notes also include as a companion piece the talk by my friend Thomas Manopulo on Chow groups.

#### Some old lecure notes

I cannot really recommend reading the following notes (quite some time has passed since I took these courses and I cannot vouch for what I wrote), but there might be some interesting tidbits here and there.

- [Algebraic Topology I]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/old_lecture_notes/AT1.pdf), taught by Prof. Stefan Schwede in the Winter Semester 21/22. These were my first typed notes, so beware, but I enjoyed writing them quite a lot. They might be a good introduction to simplicial sets, fibrations, Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and some other basic tools of the trade and fundamental results in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

- [Algebraic Topology II]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/old_lecture_notes/AT2.pdf), taught by Prof. Stefan Schwede in the Summer Semester 22. An introduction to stable homotopy theory (via orthogonal spectra). Someone might find worthwhile the detailed introduction to cofibration categories (more general and somewhat easier to deal with than model categories, but still powerful) and triangulated categories.

- [Representation Theory II]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/old_lecture_notes/RT2.pdf), taught by Prof. Catharina Stroppel in the Winter Semester 22/23. An introduction to some of the basics of geometric representation theory (e.g. flag and Schubert varieties, Hecke algebras and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, Coxeter groups, the Borel-Weil theorem), which might be more elementary and concrete than most.
