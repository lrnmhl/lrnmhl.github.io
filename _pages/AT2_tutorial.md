Welcome!

This is the page for the Algebraic Topology II tutorial which takes place at 16 on Thursday. If you are not following the course but for some reason are reading this page, you can find notes for the course and the exercise sheets on [Jack's webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/jackmdavies/teaching?authuser=0) or on the eCampus page for the course.

If you are taking the course, submit your solutions to: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. As usual, you need 50% of the points to be admitted to the exam. Presenting solutions during the seminar is not required for admission to the exam, but warmly encouraged.

**Public Service Announcement:** Please do tell me before the tutorial if you want to see the solutions to some of the self-study exercises, so that I can prepare them and (time permitting, and it won't permit too much tbh) present or sketch them in the tutorial. Similarly, feel free to send by email any question about the material of the course if you think it might be something interesting to discuss in the meeting.

#### Tutorial logbook

I'll record here what we did during the tutorials and if needed post additional stuff to tie up loose ends.

- Zeroth tutorial (18/04/24): A chill affair, we reviewed the basics of simplicial sets and quasi-categories. In the end I had to rush through the proof of simplicial groups being Kan complexes, [here]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial0_Loose_Ends.pdf) is a write-up of a readable (I hope!) proof.

- First tutorial (25/04/24): I wasn't very well prepared today, sorry for that. In any case, we just corrected the exercises, which everybody smashed anyway, so not much to add. Maybe one small takeaway: when proving adjunctions, it's worth trying to reduce them to already known natural bijections.

- Second tutorial (02/05/24): Small audience today, I hope most people were out enjoying the sun and touching grass (recommended if you are studying homotopy theory[^1]). Anyway, a couple of announcements: first, see the PSA above, second, next thursday is a public holiday so there will be no meeting in person and I will upload a write-up of the solutions here instead, third, I wrote [some comments]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial2_Loose_Ends.pdf) about this week's exercises (I don't think I will have time to actually write down the solutions in full, though).

- Third tutorial (no meeting): Sooo... we don't have an elementary solution of Problem 8, we will upload one later explaining some of the technology one can use to prove this kind of statements, for now you can have a look at the [other exercises]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/AT2Tutorial/AT2Tutorial3_Partial_Solution.pdf). By the way, I still haven't finished correcting the third sheet (sorry, I've been terribly busy!) but don't worry, it's coming.
