Welcome!

This is the page for the Algebraic Topology II tutorial which takes place at 16 on Thursday. If you are not following the course but for some reason are reading this page, you can find notes for the course and the exercise sheets on [Jack's webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/jackmdavies/teaching?authuser=0) or on the eCampus page for the course.

If you are taking the course, submit your solutions to: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. As usual, you need 50% of the points to be admitted to the exam. Presenting solutions during the seminar is not required for admission to the exam, but warmly encouraged.

#### Tutorial logbook

I'll record here what we did during the tutorials and if needed post additional stuff to tie up loose ends.

- Zeroth tutorial (18/04/24): A chill affair, we reviewed the basics of simplicial sets and quasi-categories. In the end I had to rush through the proof of simplicial groups being Kan complexes, [here]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/notes/Simplicial_groups_are_Kan_complexes.pdf) is a write-up of a readable (I hope!) proof.

- First tutorial (25/04/24): I wasn't very well prepared today, sorry for that. Anyway, we just corrected the exercises, which everybody smashed anyway, so nothing much to add.
