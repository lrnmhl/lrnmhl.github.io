Welcome!

This is the page for the Algebraic Topology II tutorial which takes place at 16 on Thursday. If you are not following the course but for some reason are reading this page, you can find notes for the course and the exercise sheets on [Jack's webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/jackmdavies/teaching?authuser=0) or on the eCampus page for the course.

If you are taking the course, submit your solutions to: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. As usual, you need 50% of the points to be admitted to the exam. Presenting solutions during the seminar is not required for admission to the exam, but warmly encouraged.

#### Tutorial logbook

- First tutorial (18/04/24): A chill affair, we reviewed the basics of simplicial sets and quasi-categories. In the end I had to rush through the proof of simplicial groups being Kan complexes, [here]({{https://lrnmhl.github.io}}/assets/pdf/notes/Simplicial_groups_are_Kan_complexes.pdf) is a write-up of a readable (I hope!) proof.

- Plan for the second tutorial on 25/04/24: Apart from correcting the first exercise sheet, we will try to give some motivation for introducing $$\infty$$-categories and talk about what's happening in the course.
