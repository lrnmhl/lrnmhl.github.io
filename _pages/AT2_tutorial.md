Welcome!

This is the page for the Algebraic Topology II tutorial which takes place at 16 on Thursday.

Submit your solutions to: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. Presenting solutions during the seminar is not required for admission to the exam, but heavily encouraged.

First tutorial (18/04/24): A chill affair, we reviewed the basics of simplicial sets and quasi-categories. In the end I had to rush through the proof of simplicial groups being Kan complex, soon I will upload a write-up of the exercise!

Second tutorial on 25/04/24: Apart from correcting the first exercise sheet, we will try to give some motivation for introducing $$\infty$$-categories and talk about what's happening in the course.
