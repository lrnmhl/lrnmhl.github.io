Welcome to my page! I am a master student at the University of Bonn. I like mathematics and physics.

In the Summer Semester 2024 I will be tutoring for the course Algebraic Topology II taught by Jack Davies and Liz Tatum. I plan to use [this page](/AT2_tutorial/) to upload stuff relevant to the tutorial (eventually).

My email: s6milore@uni-bonn.de. Feel free to contact me for anything!
