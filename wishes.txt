Eventually the webpage will have the following subpages (in this order):

 - About
 - (Research)
 - Expository Stuff
 - Tutorial (subsubpages: Old tutorials)
 - (Blog, possibly under Personal)
 - Contact
 - Personal, a drop down with subsubpages: Why I Do Math, Mental Health, Music, (Blog, possibly its own subpage)

The Contact subpage would read something like this:
	
	You can reach me by email (or whatever) at: ...
	
	Feel free to contact me anytime, for any reason! I'm especially happy to talk if:

	 - you want to talk about mathematics (e.g. you have doubts about something I've written, or you want to suggest improvements/corrections),

	 - you are in academia at any level and you want someone to talk to about this weird life (check also this page),

	 - you want to play some music with me (in which case check this other page).
